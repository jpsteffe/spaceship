# Spaceship
Spaceship is a very old game that I made in highschool as one of my first programming projects. At the time I wasn't aware that I was making an Asteroids clone, but after it was pointed out to me, I reskinned the game with a space theme and that is how it got it's name.

## Features
The game in it's current state is playable with Python 2.7 and pygame, however some features were lost to time. 

Currently, the Options, Highscores, and Quit buttons on the main menu will exit the game. 

The Play button will actually start the game where you can try to evade the asteroids as the come at you from the top of the screen. 

The game ends when you are hit by an asteroid, you then have to either press escape to end the game or X out of the window as the restart feature wasn't added yet.
